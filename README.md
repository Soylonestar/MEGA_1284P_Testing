# MEGA_1284P_Testing

## Purpose and Reason
This is my personal project on getting to know how to work the Mega-1284P board. There is no limit what I'll do with it. <br/>
It can be from lighting an LED to trying an LCD and sending USART data to it via I2C protocol, etc. It can be anything. <br/>
Of course all of this will be documented and explained as to what I did with updates...
